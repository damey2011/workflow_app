> Backend/API service for a simple workflow automation software

## Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
This uses the default settings in the `settings.py` file, but in other to use
custom settings e.g. different database user or database name, then duplicate the 
`settings.ini` file and name it `settings.dev.ini` and put in your own values here.
The reason for duplicating is that, `settings.dev.ini` is ignored by git so it 
doesn't affect the other developer. This way we can keep different custom 
non-application-dependent settings.

## Extra

If there is a need to export the database on the remote server to use on development machine, 
we can reach 
```bash
https://sitename.com/utility/db-export/
```
Understood that this may be a security risk, so it's going to be available only in 
development mode i.e. when `DEBUG=True` in settings.
