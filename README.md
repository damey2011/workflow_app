## Install

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
This uses the default settings in the `settings.py` file, but in order to use
custom settings e.g. different database user or database name, then duplicate the 
`settings.dev.ini` file and name it `settings.ini` and put in your own values here.
The reason for duplicating is that, `settings.ini` is ignored by git so it 
doesn't affect the other developer. This way we can keep different custom 
non-application-dependent settings.

### Authentication  
We are using a (modified) Django rest-framework in-built token authentication (similar to JWT). After a login or signup, you must include the authentication token in your request header like this;  
```sh
{  
 Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b  
}  
```
Take not of the "Token" keyword before the actual token, it must be included exactly the same way, else Django rest-framework won't acknowledge it. When a token has expired, the user will need to login in again and a refreshed token will be issued. Token lifespan is 24 hours.

## Extra
If there is a need to export the database on the remote server to use on development machine, 
we can reach 
```bash
https://sitename.com/utility/db-export/
```
Understood that this may be a security risk, so it's going to be available only in 
development mode i.e. when `DEBUG=True` in settings.
